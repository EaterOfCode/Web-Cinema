![Web Cinema](header.gif)

Ever made an animation for the web and thought, I wish I could make that into a gif?!

Web Cinema will be the solution!

## What is Web Cinema?

Web Cinema is a [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit) application that makes from your beautiful HTML/CSS/Javascript animations gifs!

## How does it work?

By providing a JavaScript file with some functions for DOM operations, a HTML source and a storyboard, we generate some images and we sqeeuze them into one big gif!

## But why?

I HAVE NO IDEA

## Isn't creating that project file really annoying?

Yes it is! so I'm creating an IDE for it :D

## Is it any good?

header.gif is the result of sample/main.js. So I guess we can say its good!
