![Web Cinema](header.gif)

Ever made an animation for the web and thought, I wish I could make that into a gif or a video?!

Web Cinema will be the solution!

## What is Web Cinema?

Web Cinema is a [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit) application that makes from your beautiful HTML/CSS/Javascript animations videos!

## How does it work?

By providing a JavaScript file with some functions for DOM operations, we generate some images and we sqeeuze them into ffmpeg and ffmpeg pukes your video in your favourite format

## But what about sound?!

I have no idea! Maybe later. but now I dont know how to implement that.

## Why is this project still empty

Because I have great ideas but I am dumb and forget to make them reality
